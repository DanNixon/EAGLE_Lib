# EAGLE libraries

My library of "go to" parts for [EAGLE](https://cadsoft.io).

All parts in the `custom` directory are mine, included (as submodules) are other
libraries I frequently use:

  - [Adafruit library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Eagle-Library)
  - [Sparkfun library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries)
  - [Sick of Beige](https://github.com/DangerousPrototypes/Sick_of_Beige)
  - [lbr_usr](https://github.com/robertstarr/lbr_user/)
